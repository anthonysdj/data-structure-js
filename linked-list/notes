linked list
- does not have index
- starts with first element which is called head
- has a linked to the next value in the linked list

doubly linked list
- has reference to the previous element

circular linked list
- last value has reference to the first value

Pros
- when inserting, getting, deleting element in the beginning
- efficient because elements doest not need to shift

Cons
- getting items in the list that is not the first because you need to loop through the other elements to get to them
